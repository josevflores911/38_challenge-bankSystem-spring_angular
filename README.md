# 42_bank_system-spring_angular
proyecto realizado con java y angular para registrar transferencias entre usuarios
<hr>
 <p>We begin with the presentation of the pages. This project was developed with Java and JavaScript using the Spring and Angular frameworks. Before starting the project, a sketch of how the pages would look like was created with HTML. Angular works with the Single Page Application (SPA) model, so all pages are rendered as needed on the index.html page. The remaining pages are designed through the Angular engine.</p>

  <p>The first page of the application is where user data is entered, simulating access to their account. The dummy account details are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Account Number: 123456789012</li>
    <li>Key: 1234</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Immediately, a window is rendered that provides access to the user's transfers, where the following operations can be performed:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>List all transactions (search for a transfer by date or any filter can be added)</li>
    <li>Remove transactions (logical removal)</li>
    <li>Create a new transaction</li>
  </ul>
